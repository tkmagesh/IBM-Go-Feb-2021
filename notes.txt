     - C
1980 - C++
1995 - Ruby
1997 - Java

2010 - Go lang

Time taken for Compilation
Simpler Syntax

Enhanced Package Management


Concurrency
    Multiple Threads
        2 MB
        Resource Intensive (Disadvantage)
        Relatively simple implementation (Advantage)

    Single Thread (Our application is executed using only one thread)
        NOT resource intensive (Advantage)
        Complex Implementation (Disadvantage)

    go routines
        one can run 1000s of go routines in ONE thread
        each go routine using only 2 kb of memory
        Scheduler is builtin in the runtime
        concurrency is a language feature
        builtin constructs in the language for concurrency
            go, chan (data type), select, range

No class
    Class = blue print for an object
    object = encapsulation of state & behavior
        State (struct), Behavior (functions), abstraction (Interface)
        Prefer composition over inheritance
        
No access modifiers
Support for pointers
Support for higher order functions
    Functions are first class citizens
    Functions can be treated like data
        Functions can be assigned to variables
        Higher order functions
            Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
            Functions can be returned as return values from another function

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for uint32, represents a Unicode code point)

    array
        fixed length
        can have only the data of the same type
        use indexer to access the values of the array

    slice
        built on top of the array
        can be of varying size
        can have the data of the same type
        supports the slice operation

    map
        collection of key/value pairs
        dynamic size
        type of the key and value can vary

    No implicit type conversion
        Syntax for type casting is Type(value)

    int32 x = 10
    int64 y = int64(x)
